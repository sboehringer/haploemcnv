\title{Produces an initial value matrix}
\usage{
EM_init_mat(lst, init_equal = TRUE, start_HTFs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lst}{A list. Each possible diplotype of an individual has a separate argument, can be obtained via \code{\link{all_options}}.}

\item{init_equal}{A logical scalar. Whether or not the probabilities in the initial value matrix are equal (a 0 when diplotype is not compatible with individuals diplotype call, and a 1 when the diplotype is compatible) or that the number of times a compatible diplotype is stated in \code{lst} equals the value the initial value matrix should have (\code{TRUE} is default).}

\item{start_HTFs}{An optional vector. Haplotype frequencies where the diplotype frequencies of the first iteration are started with. If a haplotype is not specified here, it will get a frequency equal to half of the minimum supplied frequency}
}
\value{
A matrix with the initial values for the EM-algorithm. Each column represents a possible diplotype (that has been observed for at least one of the individuals) and each row represents a individual.
}
\description{
Initial value matrix consists a 1 for all diplotypes that are compatible with the data, and a 0 for all diplotypes that are not compatible. Support function of \code{\link{EM_algorithm}}.
