\title{Naive HT reconstruction analysis with the EM-algorithm updated diplotype list}
\usage{
Naive_EMbased_analysis(lst, haplo = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lst}{A list. Data containing the possible diplotypes of each donor as a separate list element, can be obtained via \code{\link{all_options}}.}

\item{haplo}{A logical scalar. Whether or not diplotype frequencies are estimated by first estimating haplotype frequencies, or immediately start by estimating diplotype frequencies (\code{TRUE} is default).}
}
\description{
Runs the naive analysis with the EM-algorithm updated diplotype list, to be compared to the analysis of the complete EM-algorithm based \code{\link{HT_reconstruction}}.
